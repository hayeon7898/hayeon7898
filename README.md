# Hi 👩🏻‍💻

Undergraduate researcher interested in vision–language models,
multimodal reasoning, and real-world AI systems. <br>
I enjoy translating complex problems into structured, deployable AI solutions.

## ✨ Core Research Interests
- Vision–Language Models (multimodal reasoning, affect-aware interaction)
- Visual Representation Learning in real-world and industrial settings
- Reasoning-oriented AI systems integrating vision, language, and decision-making

## 🤖 Selected AI Research & Projects

### Emotion-Aware Vision–Language Model for Elderly Interaction
*🏆 Hackathon Grand Prize hosted by SK Intellix*
- Designed a multimodal VLM system integrating speech, facial expression, and text
  for emotion-aware interaction with elderly users
- Built a fusion pipeline using Whisper, wav2vec, and ResNet-18 to address
  cross-modal inconsistency in emotional signals
- Iteratively refined prompting strategies to guide the LLM toward
  emotionally appropriate responses under ambiguous inputs  

### Visual Defect Detection for Pipe Welding Rework Optimization
- Developed RGB-based and X-ray-based defect detection models for industrial
  pipe welding inspection
- Trained ConvNeXt V2 on balanced RGB datasets and YOLOv8 on highly imbalanced
  X-ray datasets to learn robust visual representations
- Integrated defect detection as an upstream module for data-driven
  rework decision-making and scheduling automation  

### LLM-based OKR Evaluation and Feedback Agent
*🏆 Korea University Capstone Design Competition – Honorable Mention*
- Designed an LLM-based reasoning agent that evaluates company-authored OKRs
  using structured scoring (1–5), justification, and corrective suggestions
- Applied chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency to improve
  reliability of reasoning outputs
- Integrated retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with company-specific data
  and explored parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA, quantization) on
  LLaMA-based models
